        Aside these projects, my main experience is participating in Columbia University's Jumpstarting Aspiring Develeopers and Entrepreneurs (JADE) 
        program which is particularly focused on underrepresented communities. As one of the 20 members who got into this program out of about 81 applicants,
        I learned web designing using HTML, CSS, and React. I also got the opportunity to visit several Fortune 500 companies link
        Meta, Microsoft, Google, IBM and also some start-ups like VIAM and DeliveryZero.
